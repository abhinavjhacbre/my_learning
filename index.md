# GitPad

A local version of my notes that I've learned while working with CBRE.

Topics I'm covering:

- [Progressive Web Apps(PWA)][1] - In these notes, I'm going to mention what are the key factors of converting an existing web application into Progressive Web Apps. Some history on how this is evolved and some javascript code to setup service working on an existing app or a new app.
